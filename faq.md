### Will there be a conference registration fee? 
Since the early stages of planning, our objective has been to keep the conference registration fees as low as possible, ideally at zero. Thanks to the support of our sponsors, we can now confirm that registration will not exceed 50 CAD (approximately 30 EUR) for any participant. We continue to seek additional sponsorship and remain committed to reducing the fee further, with the goal of eliminating it entirely.

Participants are responsible for paying their lodging and meals directly to the Auberge, as well as covering any travel costs.

### When will the workshop start and end?
The program is not finalized yet. We aim to start the workshop around 9:00-9:30 on Tuesday, May 26. The workshop will end around 17:00 on Thursday, May 28. 

### What currency are prices listed in?
All prices in the lodging reservation form and on the website are listed in Canadian dollars (CAD).

### What kind of weather should I expect?
Daytime temperatures in late May are typically 15–20 °C (60–68 °F) and drop to 5–10 °C (40–50 °F) at night.

### Need a ride to or from Montreal?
Use [this carpooling form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10zqtG1m-qCfEho7iScyOeJt__isk9W--V2AQNObMTcA/edit?usp=sharing) to find or offer a ride.

### Is childcare available?
No. Childcare is not provided on site or nearby. However, families are welcome to enjoy the Auberge’s many activities: indoor pool, lake access, trails, and more.

### How do I book my stay and meals?
Participants must fill out a form indicating their arrival/departure dates, lodging preferences, and roommate/housemate details.

### Can I share a cottage or condo with someone arriving on a different date?
No. Shared accommodations require identical check-in and check-out dates.

### Do I need to register for just one day?
Yes. Even for a single day, registration is required to manage space and plan refreshments.

### How far are the rooms from the meeting space?
All lodging options are within a 5-minute walk. The distance from the Auberge to the conference center is under 150 m.
