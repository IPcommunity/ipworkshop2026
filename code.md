## Code of conduct

We are committed to fostering a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for all attendees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Harassment of any kind, whether in person or through email, messaging platforms, or other digital channels, will not be tolerated. Anyone engaging in inappropriate behavior may face removal from the event, at the discretion of the organizing committee.

If you witness or experience conduct that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, please speak with a member of the Local Organizing Committee (LOC) right away. LOC members can be identified by their name badges. Anonymous reports may also be submitted via the 8th International IP Workshop complaint form.

All reports will be handled with care and discretion, and responses will be tailored to the situation. No information will be shared without consent.
