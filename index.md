The Auberge is located about 2 hours by car from both Montréal and Québec. There is no public transportation available. Participants will need to rent a car. We will provide tools to faciliate car pooling for those interested. 

The Auberge offers an all-inclusive package that includes both lodging and meals. There are no alternative accommodation or dining options in the vicinity. 

## Registration
Registrations details TBA. 

## Lodging options

Accommodations include rooms at the inn, pavilions, condos (2 or 5 rooms), and cottages (4 or 5 rooms).

All rooms feature a private bathroom, individual key access, internet, air conditioning, and nearby parking. Bed configurations vary from single to queen beds, with either one or two beds per room.

Condos and cottages include a full kitchen and living room. Pavilion rooms come with a mini fridge and coffee maker, while pavilion suites offer a kitchenette and lounge area. Rooms at the inn also have a mini fridge and coffee maker.

All buildings are within a ~5-minute walk from the main conference center. Participants may request to share a condo or cottage with others.
