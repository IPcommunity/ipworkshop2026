In the 7th workshop on Induced Polarization (IP) in Lund, May 28-30, 2024, the community had discussions on

* comparability of different processing and inversion algorithms
* providing an overview on existing software, their potential and limitations
* creating benchmark models to test software on
* a collection of (already published) data sets with existing reference data to test existing or future codes
* a standard format for storing DCIP data (interoperability)

To start discussion and collection, we created several public github repositories to that everyone in the community can contribute. 
* [Field data](https://github.com/IPcommunity/field-data)
* [Data standards](https://github.com/IPcommunity/data-standard)
* [Raw data processing](https://github.com/IPcommunity/processing)
* [Field protocols](https://github.com/IPcommunity/field-protocols)
* [Benchmark models](https://github.com/IPcommunity/benchmark-models)
* [Software](https://github.com/IPcommunity/software)
* [This website](https://github.com/IPcommunity/IPcommunity.github.io)
